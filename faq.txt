    There are some questions I get asked a lot on the course, so I've copied some of them below. You can see a full list of questions at http://codeschool.org.uk/faq.php - please check there before posting in the forums or emailing.

    How do I get the cool free stuff?

    This is explained in lecture 4. In short, go to ecowebhosting.co.uk/cp/webdevcourse to sign up for the hosting and you’ll be given links to all the extras.

    Can I download the course videos?

    Yes, you can download the course videos using the Udemy iPhone/iPad and Android apps. You cannot download the videos to a PC at this time.

    I’m having problems playing the videos

    Please try using a different browser and/or internet connection. If that doesn’t help, please contact Udemy, as I don’t control the Udemy website.

    How long does my free web hosting last?

    For each course, the web hosting lasts for 3 months, extended to 12 months when you write a review.

    I’ve bought 2 courses - how do I extend my hosting?

    You can add a course at ecowebhosting.co.uk/cp/profile.

    I wrote a review but didn’t receive notification of the hosting extension - what should I do?

    That's most likely because your Udemy name wasn't entered correctly when you signed up for Eco Web Hosting. You can change it at http://www.ecowebhosting.co.uk/cp/profile, and there is a guide to getting your Udemy name at http://youtu.be/AGuWxsqsKgs.

    If you haven't signed up for Eco Web Hosting yet, please watch the first few videos of the course as they will guide you through the process.

    Once you have updated your username, you can verify your review on that page, or wait for an hour and it will be verified for you.

    Please can I have a refund?

    Absolutely - you can do this up to 30 days after buying the course through Udemy directly via https://support.udemy.com/customer/portal/articles/1507981-can-i-get-a-refund-?b_id=3056
