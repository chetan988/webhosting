	<p> <abbr> CSS </abbr> : cascade style sheet <br />
		css is used to add more visual effect to html<br /><br />
		Let us start the learning process <br /> </p>

<p> css code can be Embeded in the applicable tags to change their apperance.<br >
	This method call inline css. This is not recomended becuse there are lot of cool stuff that can be done.<br /><br />
	Lets start with example. </p>
	
	<p> Tag : &ltp <em> style="parameter1:value1;parameter2:value2;..." </em> > paragraph content &lt/p><br />
		example :<br/>
		&nbsp&nbsp &ltp> This line is with out style &lt/p><br /><br />
		&nbsp&nbsp &ltp> style="color:blue;font-size:150%"> This line is with style &lt/p><br />
		output :
		&nbsp&nbsp <p> This line is with out style </p>
		&nbsp&nbsp <p style="color:blue;font-size:150%"> This line is with style</p></p>

		<p> Disadvantage of inline css 
			<ul>
				<li> In source page both the content and style sheet will be written which will make the code hard to read </li>
				<li> If we have 500 paragraph so we will have 500 style sheet code to make them look similar </li>
				<li> In latter stage if we want to make a small change on paragraph we have to do it in all 500 places</li>
			</ul>
		To over come above disadvantage we have <b><em>internal css</em></b>.<br />
		 
		<ul>
			<li> The Internal css are usually added in the head tag</li>
			<li> They are created with tag so when a perticular tag gets added the attached css also get effective </li>
			<li> Chang the css at one place it will effect thoughout the page </li>	
		</ul>
		Lets take a simple example :<br />
		&lthtml><br />
		&nbsp&nbsp&lthead><br />
		&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&ltstyle type="css/text"><br />
		&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspp {<br />
		&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp color:red;<br />
		&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp }<br />
		&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&lt/style><br />
		&nbsp&nbsp&lt/head><br /><br />
		&nbsp&nbsp&ltbody><br />
		&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&ltp> This is line 1.&lt/p><br />
		&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&ltp> This is line 2.&lt/p></br>
		&nbsp&nbsp&lt/body><br />
		&lt/html><br /><br />
		output : <br />
		<p style="color:red">  This is line 1.</p><br />
		<p style="color:red">  This is line 2.</p><br /><br />
		If we will make the color to green it will affect all the paragraph<br /><br />
		&lthtml><br />
		&nbsp&nbsp&lthead><br />
		&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&ltstyle type="css/text"><br />
		&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspp {<br />
		&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp color:green;<br />
		&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp }<br />
		&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&lt/style><br />
		&nbsp&nbsp&lt/head><br /><br />
		&nbsp&nbsp&ltbody><br />
		&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&ltp> This is line 1.&lt/p><br />
		&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&ltp> This is line 2.&lt/p></br>
		&nbsp&nbsp&lt/body><br />
		&lt/html><br /><br />
		output : <br />
		<p style="color:green">  This is line 1.</p><br />
		<p style="color:green">  This is line 2.</p><br /><br />
